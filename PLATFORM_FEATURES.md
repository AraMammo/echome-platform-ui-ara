### Objection Handling

**Objection:** "AI content sounds generic and robotic"

**Objection:** "I tried AI writing tools and they didn't match my style"
**Response:** "Those tools rely on prompts. EchoMe learns from your actual content - videos, podcasts, articles. It's not guessing your style, it's learning it."

**Response:** "Upload a file. Pick formats. Generate. That's it. Most users create their first content kit in under 5 minutes."

**Objection:** "What if the AI voice changes over time?"
**Response:** "EchoMe has voice drift detection and snapshots. If your AI voice changes, we alert you and let you restore previous versions."

**Objection:** "I don't trust AI with my brand voice"
**Response:** "You're in control. Vote on outputs to teach the AI what you like. Check the Taste Profile to see what it's learned. Adjust anytime."
